The aim of this analysis is to predict which teams will make the NFL playoffs using historical information. Specifically we want to use data from 2001 to 2018 to predict the most recent season, 2019.

The data is sourced as part of #tidytuesday and can be found [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-02-04/readme.md)

## Data exploration

```{r}
# Get the Data
